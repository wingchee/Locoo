			"description" : "Locoo comes from a Spanish word which means ‘Crazy’, ‘Insane’ or ‘Mad. All the while, Locoo works based on the idea of “I want to die for fashion style” or better to say-LOCOO works based on the idea of “I want to die with my own fashion style”.To us, “Style” is a form of fashion that that doesn’t go off trends and “Trends” are seasonal fashions. Thereof, we wanted to build a long-term style rather than a short-term trend.Besides that, Locoo uphold the idea of MIX and MATCH as our main conviction. We do not have a specific point of view when talk about fashion, as we do not want to restrict peoples from bringing out their own style."
